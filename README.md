## Description

Welcome to our front end web project for an online market! This project is designed to showcase my front end development skills. i have created a fully functional online market experience that allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and checkout securely.

My project does not use a backend for data storage or retrieval. Instead, I have included sample product data in a JSON file, which is loaded into the application using JavaScript. This allows us to create a realistic online market experience without the need for server-side programming.

The user interface is built using React jsx and css. My design focuses on simplicity and usability, with clear navigation and straightforward checkout process.

This project includes the following features:

    Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
    Ability to browse and search for products
    Detailed product pages with images, descriptions, and pricing
    Cart functionality that allows users to add, remove, and update items
    Secure checkout process with validation and error handling

Our project is open source and available on GitHub for anyone to view and contribute to. We welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement. Please feel free to clone the repository and try the application out for yourself.
